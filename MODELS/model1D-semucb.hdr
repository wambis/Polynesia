From Raj Moulik and Yann Capdeville

he second line has the flag for whether the model is radially
anisotropic (ifanis=1 if true), reference period where the elastic
specified in the given file is strictly valid (typically 1.0 sec), and
if the file is a card deck file or a polynomial file.

Third line contains the number of layers (n) followed by the indices
of the top of the ICB AND OCB discontinuity (+ in Dahlen and Tromp
definition) and the number of ocean layers,
