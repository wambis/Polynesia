From Raj Moulik (pers. comm.) and Yann Capdeville (yannos.generate_1Dmodel.f90)

The second line has the flag for whether the model is radially
anisotropic (ifanis=1 if true), reference period where the elastic
specified in the given file is strictly valid (typically 1.0 sec), and
if the file is a card deck file or a polynomial file.

Third line contains the NUMBER of layers (n) followed by the INDICES
of the top of the ICB and OCB discontinuities (+ in Dahlen and Tromp)
and the NUMBER of ocean layers. (This last bit is not widely adopted.)

Compare with, where the last entry on the third line is 'moho'.
