Data and code to reproduce figures of a forthcoming publication.

CONTENTS:

DATA/C012798D.90_250_windows.filter.json
-> One typical json file that leads to entries in all the tables below

DATA/Surfacewave_90_250_example.dat
-> One typical dat file that contains entries composed from the json file above
-> The name of this file contains the data type and the period band.

TableHeader.txt
-> All those tables have the same type of information

Maybe the final form is some other table (not ASCII).  Whatever format
we come up with, different ones, we give an example with just a few
entries. And then share the bigger tables some other way.

For example, if the tables end up as *.mat files (for MATLAB)

DATA/Bodywaves_17_40.mat
DATA/Bodywaves_40_100.mat

DATA/Surfacewave_40_100.mat
DATA/Surfacewave_90_250.mat
