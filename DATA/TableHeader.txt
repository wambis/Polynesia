CCT: delay time at maximum cross-correlation between s(t) and d(t)
     where s(t) is the modeled data in GLAD-M25 (synthetic)
     	   d(t) is the observed data
	   data are instrument-corrected displacement waveforms
     delay time is
     argmax_tau [gamma(tau)] [CHECK]
     gamma(tau)= \int s(t) d(t-tau) dt [CHECK]
     which implies that if CCT is NEGATIVE, the synthetic is slow compared to data [CHECK]
     see figure: ost1
max_CTT: the actual cross-correlation value at CCT
B: the beginning of the time window over which the measurements are made
E: the end of the time window over which the measurements are made
   relative to the earthquake origin time 
weight: data weight as assigned by Lei et al. (2020)
dlnA: logarithmic amplitude measurement:
