CCT: delay time at maximum cross-correlation between s(t) and d(t)
     where s(t) is the modeled data in GLAD-M25 (synthetic)
     	   d(t) is the observed data
	   data are instrument-corrected displacement waveforms
     delay time is
     argmax_tau [gamma(tau)] [CHECK]
     gamma(tau)= \int s(t) d(t-tau) dt [CHECK]
     which implies that if CCT is NEGATIVE, the synthetic is slow compared to data [CHECK]
     see figure: ost1
max_CTT: the actual cross-correlation value at CCT
B: the beginning of the time window over which the measurements are made
E: the end of the time window over which the measurements are made
   relative to the earthquake origin time 

weight: data weight as assigned by Lei et al. (2020), which is the
length of the window divided by the minimum period of the band
considered and then multiplied by the cross-correlation maximum

dlnA: logarithmic amplitude measurement:
